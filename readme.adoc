= jQAssistant Parser Plugin

This is a Parser Plugin of https://www.jqassistant.org[jQAssistant^].

(Work in Progress)

== Notes on Custom Parsers

- on Functions/Lambdas as Parameters
    - https://dzone.com/articles/why-theres-interface
    - chose Supplier instead of Callable, since it is more similar to Function (especially: doesn't throw Exception)
- on Matcher::group(): seams so that int as parameter doesn't work the same as named parameter (String)
    - maybe will need String-Identifier for every Symbol
    - TODO: try more variants to see if that's avoidable

== Notes on ANTLR4

- ANTLR Setup / Maven
